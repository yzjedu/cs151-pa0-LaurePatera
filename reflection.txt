It was really fun being able to solve a problem for someone I know, because it meant that I had to think more creatively
and outside of the box than I would sometimes if I was following a prompt from class or from the textbook. It was really
fun to see what worked and what wouldnâ€™t, and treating my coding project like a job from a client instead of just a piece
of homework. I definitely prefer working by myself instead of with a partner, but I saw that coming already because I
prefer working alone on most things. It was nice being able to problem-solve and troubleshoot by myself than relying on
another person for help, and getting to do every part of the process and seeing how it all fits together. Being able to
see every part of the process was cool from a learning standpoint, because I realized just how important the planning is
to the coding itself, and how much the algorithm and excel helped me out in the end. Next time, I would be more careful
about looking at the calculation I chose for my problem, but I would also try to pick something more challenging, so
that I could spend more time troubleshooting and learning new things. At first, I was not paying enough attention to
my calculation in my algorithm, so I used the wrong one, but once I tested it out a few times, I was able to find the
issue and fix it in the end.
